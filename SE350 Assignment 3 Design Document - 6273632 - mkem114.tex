\section{Walk-through}
	Students are learning about Data Computer Interaction; a new field about how to deal with data security, agency and privacy in their SOFTENG 346 paper. Their lecturer is using Facebook as an example to the class while having multiple `case with structured question(s)' peer assignments for them to work through.\\
	
	Their lecturer sets them an assessment on Papr (the learning content and management system) which has relevant information for them to review before answering each question. (\cref{fig:one})
	
	When the students ``Submit'' the answers are saved and they are taken back to their list of assessments. (\cref{fig:two}) After the deadline their answers are sent to their peers to provide feedback on their answers. They can then give their peers feedback on their answers by clicking on assessments with ``Feedback:'' in the title. (\cref{fig:two})
	
	Students can give feedback on their peer's answers and can refresh their memory by viewing the relevant questions and case. (\cref{fig:three}) When they click ``Submit'' their feedback is saved and they are taken back to the list of assessments. (\cref{fig:four})
	
	Clicking on ``Past'' portion of the assessments allows them to see assessments they have previously done. (\cref{fig:four}) Click on ``Data-mining Ethics'' will allow them to see their submitted answers and their peer's feedback for them (provided it has been given, otherwise it will be blank). (\cref{fig:five})
